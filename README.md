# Rubik's Cube Project

An interactive web app for learning and playing with the Rubik’s Cube.

### Features:
- [X] Interactive 3D Rubik's Cube and underlying logical representation (not just an animated 3D model!)
- [ ] Auto-solver using CFOP algorithm
- [ ] Visual polish (right now it’s quite grey), although not integral to the project itself

### Future Ideas:
- Step-by-step interactive Rubik’s Cube tutorial
- Support for different cube sizes (2x2, 4x4, etc.) and their associated algorithms/tutorials
